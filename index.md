## Software Developer

Passionate full-stack software developer. I have been writing code since the age of 10 after becoming curious about how the technology around me worked.
I strive to build systems that are easily maintainable, testable, and reusable.
My passion is in the reinvigorated field of functional programming, but I also love to work with data structures and algorithms, and have an understaning of object-oriented programming.

## Technical Skills

- TypeScript and JavaScript (Node.js, React.js, Webpack, and browser)
- MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- Porting other languages to TypeScript
- Efficient self-teaching, understanding new languages quickly
- Both Windows and Unix-like operating systems
- Proficient in the terminal
- Vim and VSCode
- Git (managing both single repositories and monorepos)

## Personal Skills

- Writing clearly and unerstandably
- Working efficiently
- Learning constantly
- Thinking and speaking honestly

## Achievements

Maintaining a functional-programming TypeScript prelude and library, <a href="https://github.com/principia-ts">principia.ts</a>, in order to more deeply understand the inticacies of category theory and the TypeScript type system, as well as implementation details and managing a software library. It features code forked from other TypeScript and JavaScript libraries, as well as Scala libraries, and my own features and improvements.
