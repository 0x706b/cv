## Software Developer

I am a passionate full-stack software developer, and have been writing code since the age of 10 after becoming curious about how the technology around me worked.
I strive to build systems that are easily maintainable, testable, and reusable.
My passion is in the reinvigorated field of functional programming, but I also love to work with data structures and algorithms, and have an understanding of procedural and object-oriented programming.
I read a lot of code, and I understand new concepts and languages quickly.

## Contributions and Achievements

`fncts`
I write and maintain a TypeScript functional programming library, <a href="https://github.com/0x706b/fncts">fncts</a>, with the goal of building a complete and performant effect system, as well as learning the intricacies of maintaining a software library. It features code forked from other TypeScript and JavaScript libraries, as well as Scala libraries, along with my own features and improvements.

`ts-plus`
I collaborate with other open source developers in writing and maintaining a fork of the TypeScript compiler, <a href="https://github.com/ts-plus/typescript">ts-plus</a>, which adds additional features to the language. These features include extension methods, operator overloading, type-driven function overloads, and value derivations. Through this effort, I have learned many details of the TypeScript compiler and type system.
